This Shiny App is for displaying the trend finding applications of fourier smoothing methods. Two methods are showcased here:

* The first method removes high frequency modes regardless of amiplitude. 

* The second method removes low amplitude modes regardless of frequency.

The threshold cutoff slider selects the lowest percentile to be omitted.

The data was simulated using various periodicities.

The code for this application can be found here: http://ow.ly/SwZrv
